##Week 1

**Select one work from each volume that you read and for each write:**

**What makes the work a piece of digital writing**
**A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel)**

The Fall of the Sit of Marsha – Rob Wittig (volume 1)

This is a hypertextual story as shown through the devolution of a blog page in three stages. It plays with existing digital forms of a blog to create a story of a woman's life. It manipulates the digital elements, such as glitching text and images, to show the devolution of her life/the website. The background image gets darker over each stage. I think the exploration and combination of technology (the website) and the religious/spiritual/metaphysical was fascinating, since those two concepts are typically considered opposites, and it was interesting to see how digital writing allowed for the exploration of two opposing ideas. The websites didn't function perfectly – sometimes opening each link would be missing certain elements, or they'd be structured/organised differently, and I'm not sure if it's on purpose or just old old tech. There were also links to external websites that didn't work anymore, so I'm not getting the full story, which is disappointing. 

Facade – Michael Mateas & Andrew Stern (volume 2)

Facade blurs the line between game and writing more than other pieces of e-lit. But it does have a narrative and has multiple arcs that the reader can discover through their different inputs. It was technologically innovative at the time, as the artificial intelligence at the core of the piece allows for the reader to interact with the characters in a way that hadn't been done before. I remember trying to play this game with my friends when I was a kid, but I didn't understand the purpose or narrative arcs, just that it was meant to be a game where you could talk to characters. Naturally, this meant my experience with the game was influenced by nostalgia, but I really enjoy this piece. It's fun to see what input elicits certain reactions from the characters and recognising the patterns and rhythms that the characters are trained to hit, as well as how these can be disrupted. I also enjoy the mystery of the two characters' relationship, more specifically, the issues in their relationship, and trying to find the proper input to get the proper reactions so that they confess their issues.

The Hunt For The Gay Planet – Anna Anthropy (volume 3)

The Hunt For The Gay Planet is a hypertext Twine game that satirises the video game *Star Wars: The Old Republic*, which was updated in 2013 to include queer characters, but only on one planet. The player explores planets in search of 'Lesbionica', the gay planet. It was really fun to navigate the different planets and eventually find Lesbionica. I also really enjoyed the witty, tongue-in-cheek voice of the text, which heightens its satirical nature. Since the piece was made in 2013 – the (relatively) early days of Twine – I wonder how much the possibilities of the piece were limited by Twine's capabilities at the time. I wonder if Twine was able to support sound/image/lots of colour back then. Or even if there was a limit to the lengths of the texts.

Blackout Poetry Tool – Jazer Chand (volume 4)

The Blackout Poetry Tool is a tool that allows a human and a bot to collaborate to create a piece of blackout poetry. It can only exist in a digital medium, as it is centred on the human/bot dynamic and relationship. The bot follows a pre-set grammar sequence, so that its selections for the blackout poem are grammatically sound. It raises really interesting questions regarding dichotomies – human/technology, emotional/mechanical – and challenges binary thinking. It also challenges notions of ownership/authorship. I also feel like it's particularly relevant in the current day regarding generative AI and the idea of 'computer-generated literature'. This piece was written in 2020, before that stuff even existed, and it's really interesting to see it with this new cultural context. 

##Week 3

**What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?**
**How are those elements meaningful?**
**How are the works read differently from print literature?**
**How is electronic literature different from print literature?**
**What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?**

##Week 5

**This week's Required Reading (Aarseth 1997) unpacks some territory that speak directly to some of the great questions raised in your Case Study presnetations such as "in what sense can a hypertext be a narrative? Is hypertext a literary genre or a literary technique?" It introduces the important concept of "ergotics": "hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it, as I try to demonstrate through the concept of ergodics." (p.95)**

**What do you think of Aarseth's concept? explain how it offer an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?**

##Week 6

How does it work? What does it do? How does the reader interact with the piece? What is conveyed by the digital work?
How does the digital affordance work with the piece’s themes? Does its function deepen the meaning and interpretation of the themes for you as a reader?
Think about: the relationship between imagery and text; how the text changes between readings; how movement acts in the work; the structure of the work; the technologies used.
How does this work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece? Requirement for final folio write 250 to 300 (minimum) words on this (can be done any time this week)
