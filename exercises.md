## Week 3

**How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?**

I think the main difference in how I feel about code is that now, coding is something real and tangible that I can comprehend in my mind rather than some abstract complex thing. It's like learning a new language, and now I feel like I can say basic greetings and count to, maybe, five. But I feel like now, coding is something that I can actually do, and tackle. It's still a bit scary, because it is learning a new language and it feels like I don't have enough time to become fluent enough to create my own piece of digital writing. I don't think Glitch will be my preferred medium though, and I hope that I will be drawn to one of the other mediums that we will explore in class.

**Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?**

### Wednesday

For my poetry experimentation, I reworked a piece I wrote last year about motherhood and my relationship with my mum. I do think it was interesting how even when everything is totally changed, I can still feel the essence of what the original piece was about. But maybe that is because I already know the piece. I wonder how it reads to a pair of fresh eyes.

Any day now, I will go crazy thinking about your import to my vitality. I want you to know the you that you thought of as a girl; I want to stay in your ribs until our worlds finish. I donâ€™t long to go back to the familiar, I just start missing you. I think faithfully about the life you had before you birthed your offspring.
