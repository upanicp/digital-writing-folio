## Week 3
**What aspects of the remix are the same?**

For me, the remixes are the same at their basic concepts. I didn't change any of the formatting or functions, I only changed the contents and styles. I know we were told we could come up with a different type of poem for the haiku and everything else, but I was so nervous that if I change anything other than the script as it was given I would break something and it would be ruined, and I wish I did step out of my comfort zone a little more.

**What aspects of the remix are different?**

Like I said, the content and the style. There is no rhyme or reason to what I changed about the style, I just thought about what I like, even if doesn't match the rest of the page, or even the specific piece itself. I was mostly just experimenting here.

**Is the remix successful (why or why not)?**

The remixes are successful in that they are functioning. None of the content that I changed makes up fully realised poems/pieces of literature, but I think there is at least some type of concept/idea/theme there. The error messages are all Magic 8 Ball responses and I though about the idea of blending technology and spirituality. The dropdown menu asks for years and then states what that year will mean – a half-baked exploration of the passage of time and growing up. The text messages are about how something as arbitrary as a text message from Auspost can bring so much joy and emotional attachment. The haiku is different passages from some things I've written before, and I realised that a lot of them have to do with the body and physicality. The Taroko Gorge is roughly about women's labor and how it is overlooked despite its vitality to society.


**How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?**

I think the main difference in how I feel about code is that now, coding is something real and tangible that I can comprehend in my mind rather than some abstract complex thing. It's like learning a new language, and now I feel like I can say basic greetings and count to, maybe, five. But I feel like now, coding is something that I can actually do, and tackle. It's still a bit scary, because it is learning a new language and it feels like I don't have enough time to become fluent enough to create my own piece of digital writing. I don't think Glitch will be my preferred medium though, and I hope that I will be drawn to one of the other mediums that we will explore in class.

**Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?**

### Wednesday

For my poetry experimentation, I reworked a piece I wrote last year about motherhood and my relationship with my mum. I do think it was interesting how even when everything is totally changed, I can still feel the essence of what the original piece was about. But maybe that is because I already know the piece. I wonder how it reads to a pair of fresh eyes.

                    look what you childRen have done to me

**lipograms**

Any day now, I will go crazy thinking about your import to my vitality. I want you to know the you that you thought of as a girl; I want to stay in your ribs until our worlds finish. I don’t long to go back to the familiar, I just start missing you. I think faithfully about the life you had before you birthed your offspring.


## Week 5
**What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment 2 and 3?**

I have two visions in my head right now that I think I can merge into one piece. I'm thinking about playing with the 'dungeon crawler' video game genre, but mostly in the setting/set up of a character having to travel through a dungeon-type setting. I don't think there would be any boss battles or traps or anything you'd find in an actual video game, mostly because I don't have the skill to create those, but also I don't want to take away from the actual story element. I'm interested in the idea of a story that has already happened and a character in the future finding clues to put together to figure out what happened. This is where my second idea comes in. 

I've always been fascinated by the [long-term nuclear waste warning messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages) and I think I might explore it in my piece. Maybe something like a character post-nuclear destruction world coming across a site and then exploring it and they – and the reader with them – finds out what happened. Maybe something about the ever lingering effects of humans on nature, maybe the danger once thought extinguished revealed to be sleeping, maybe the danger is slowly being nudged awake by humans once more.

**What platform and technology does it require?**

I'm interested in Bitsie. I've looked it up and I like the style of it and it suits my vision, but we haven't done any work with it yet, so I don't know if I will like it. If it doesn't seem intuitive to me, then I can work with Twine. I am comfortable with Twine, and know that whatever vision I have can be manipulated so that it can be suited to Twine.

**Do you know already if you can make it?**

Probably! Like I said, it depends on how Bitsie is. If I don't like Bitsie, I might need to do some reimagining so it can work on Twine.

**What else do you need to learn in order to execute your vision for this piece?**

Bitsie, obviously. But if I do end up working on Twine, I will need to learn how to work with images, more specifics about styles and everything, and also transitions/movements/kinetics. I might also have to ask about the processes of working with someone else who will draw some images for me maybe (is it's allowed/how I would credit them)
