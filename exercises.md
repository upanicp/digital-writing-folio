## Week 3
**What aspects of the remix are the same?**

For me, the remixes are the same at their basic concepts. I didn't change any of the formatting or functions, I only changed the contents and styles. I know we were told we could come up with a different type of poem for the haiku and everything else, but I was so nervous that if I change anything other than the script as it was given I would break something and it would be ruined, and I wish I did step out of my comfort zone a little more.

**What aspects of the remix are different?**

Like I said, the content and the style. There is no rhyme or reason to what I changed about the style, I just thought about what I like, even if doesn't match the rest of the page, or even the specific piece itself. I was mostly just experimenting here.

**Is the remix successful (why or why not)?**

The remixes are successful in that they are functioning. None of the content that I changed makes up fully realised poems/pieces of literature, but I think there is at least some type of concept/idea/theme there. The error messages are all Magic 8 Ball responses and I though about the idea of blending technology and spirituality. The dropdown menu asks for years and then states what that year will mean – a half-baked exploration of the passage of time and growing up. The text messages are about how something as arbitrary as a text message from Auspost can bring so much joy and emotional attachment. The haiku is different passages from some things I've written before, and I realised that a lot of them have to do with the body and physicality. The Taroko Gorge is roughly about women's labor and how it is overlooked despite its vitality to society.


**How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?**

I think the main difference in how I feel about code is that now, coding is something real and tangible that I can comprehend in my mind rather than some abstract complex thing. It's like learning a new language, and now I feel like I can say basic greetings and count to, maybe, five. But I feel like now, coding is something that I can actually do, and tackle. It's still a bit scary, because it is learning a new language and it feels like I don't have enough time to become fluent enough to create my own piece of digital writing. I don't think Glitch will be my preferred medium though, and I hope that I will be drawn to one of the other mediums that we will explore in class.

**Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?**

### Wednesday

For my poetry experimentation, I reworked a piece I wrote last year about motherhood and my relationship with my mum. I do think it was interesting how even when everything is totally changed, I can still feel the essence of what the original piece was about. But maybe that is because I already know the piece. I wonder how it reads to a pair of fresh eyes.

**lipograms**

Any day now, I will go crazy thinking about your import to my vitality. I want you to know the you that you thought of as a girl; I want to stay in your ribs until our worlds finish. I don’t long to go back to the familiar, I just start missing you. I think faithfully about the life you had before you birthed your offspring.
