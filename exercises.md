**How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?**

It's like learning a new language, and now I feel like I can say basic greetings and count to, maybe, five. But I feel like now, coding is something that I can actually do, and tackle. It's still a bit scary, because it is learning a new language and it feels like I don't have enough time to become fluent enough to create my own piece of digital writing.
